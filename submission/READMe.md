<!-- solutions choosen -->

For the problem of "trial", the solution chosen is to reduce the Set Cover problem to the SAT problem using the polynomial reduction method. The complexity of this solution is O(2^n _ m _ log(m)), where n is the number of elements in the set and m is the number of subsets.

For the problem of "rise", the solution chosen is to use the reduction method to convert the problem of finding the minimum number of packages required to complete a collection of cards into a SAT problem. The complexity of this solution is O(p _ m _ log(m)), where p is the number of packages available and m is the number of cards in the desired collection.

For the problem of "redemption", the solution chosen is to use an approximation algorithm to find the minimum numb
